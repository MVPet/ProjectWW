        <p>This is a project I have been working on for the past few weeks in my spare time.</p>

<h3>DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A NONPROFIT FAN GAME AND IS IN NO WAY ENDORESED BY CAPCOM.<br>ALL CHARACTERS, GRAPHICS, AND MUSIC ARE OWNED BY CAPCOM.</h3>

<a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----What is This?------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<p>This project originally began with me wanting to create a 2D version of TecmoKoei's Dynasty Warriors series. As I got around to planning it out, I discovered that a 2D Dynasty Warriors is very similar to a 2D Beat 'Em Up just with more enemies on screen.</p>

<p>From there I decided to make a game combing the two genres. Taking the mechanics of a Dynasty Warriors game, like the combat, bases, and objectives and adapting them into the style of some of my favorite Capcom Beat 'Em Ups. Since I love crossovers I decided that the cast and settings would all be focused around Capcom. A sort of Capcom All Star Beat 'Em Up.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-playable-build" class="anchor" href="#the-prototype-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----The Playable Build------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<p>Thanks to Unity, the game is playable right in your browser (assuming you have the Unity Web Player installed)</p>

<p>Features in this build include:<br>- 2 playable characters, Ryu and Servbot<br>- Randomly Generated Single Layer Stage<br>- 2 Objectives, KO n amount of enemies or capture 2 bases.These objectives will feel familiar to someone who has played a Dynasty Warriors game.</p>

<The dev build can be played with both a keybaord and a controller. The controls are:

<ul>
<li>Movement is done by the 'Arrow Keys' or 'WASD' on the keyboard. The left stick and D-Pad on a controller.</li>
<li>Light Attack is the 'I' key on the keyboard or 'Button 0' on a controller.</li>
<li>Heavy Attack is the 'O' key on the keyboard or 'Button 3' on the controller.</li>
<li>Dodge is the 'P' key on the keyboard or 'Button 2' on the controller</li>
<li>Confirm/Start is the 'Enter' key on the keyboard or 'Button 1' on the controller.</li>
<li>Pause is 'ESC' on the keyboard or 'Button 5' on the controller.</li>
</ul>

<p>The flow of combat is done by pressing Light Attack to start a low damaging combo then using Heavy Attack to perform a high damaging combo ender. Each ender is unique and depend on how many Light Attacks were used in the combo prior to the ender.</p>

<p>The combo list for the prototype is like so (H = Heavy Attack, L = Light Attack):</p>
<ul>
<li>H</li>
<li>LH</li>
<li>LLH</li>
<li>LLLH</li>
<li>LLLLH</li>
<li>LLLLL</li>
</ul>
