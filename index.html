        <p>This is a project I have been working on for the past few weeks in my spare time.</p>

<h3>DISCLAIMER:<br>THIS IS A NONPROFIT FAN GAME.<br>IT IS IN NO WAY ENDORESED BY CAPCOM.<br>ALL CHARACTERS, GRAPHICS, AND MUSIC ARE OWNED BY CAPCOM.</h3>

<a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----What is This?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<p>This project originally began with me wanting to create a 2D version of TecmoKoei's Dynasty Warriors series. As I got around to planning it out, I discovered that a 2D Dynasty Warriors is very similar to a 2D Beat 'Em Up just with more enemies on screen.</p>

<p>From there I decided to make a game combing the two genres. Taking the mechanics of a Dynasty Warriors game, like the combat, bases, and objectives and adapting them into the style of some of my favorite Capcom Beat 'Em Ups. Since I love crossovers I decided that the cast and settings would all be focused around Capcom. A sort of Capcom All Star Beat 'Em Up.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-playable-build" class="anchor" href="#the-prototype-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----The Playable Build-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<p>Thanks to Unity, the game is playable right in your browser (assuming you have the Unity Web Player installed)</p>

<p>Features in this build include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 Playable Characters, Ryu and Servbot</li>
  <li>Randomly Generated Very Basic Stage</li>
  <li>2 Objectives, KO X Amount of Enemies or Capture 2 Bases.</li>
</ul>

<p>The dev build can be played with both a keybaord and a controller. The controls are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movement is  'Arrow Keys' or 'WASD' on the keyboard. The left stick and D-Pad on a controller.</li>
<li>Light Attack is 'I' key on the keyboard or 'Button 0' on a controller.</li>
<li>Heavy Attack is 'O' key on the keyboard or 'Button 3' on the controller.</li>
<li>Dodge is 'P' key on the keyboard or 'Button 2' on the controller</li>
<li>Confirm/Start is 'Enter' key on the keyboard or 'Button 1' on the controller.</li>
<li>Pause is 'ESC' on the keyboard or 'Button 5' on the controller.</li>
</ul>

<p>The flow of combat is done by pressing Light Attack to start a low damaging combo then using Heavy Attack to perform a high damaging combo ender. Each ender is unique and depend on how many Light Attacks were used in the combo prior to the ender.</p>

<p>The combo list for the prototype is like so (H = Heavy Attack, L = Light Attack):</p>
<ul>
<li>H</li>
<li>LH</li>
<li>LLH</li>
<li>LLLH</li>
<li>LLLLH</li>
<li>LLLLL</li>
</ul>

<a id="the-playable-build" class="anchor" href="#the-prototype-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----The Future--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<p>Assuming I am able to keep this project on the down low, I would like to release a demo build with 4 playable characters and a fully playable Free Play mode, where a stage will be randomly generated.</p>

<p>Assuming this is not shut down after the demo, I plan to release a fuller build that contains at least 8 playable characters and a variety of modes. As I am working on this in my free time by myself, this may not be for a while, but I plan on meeting this goal.</p>

<p>I have something planned for the classic Beat 'Em Up fans who may not like the radically different gameplay that it will have.</p>

<a id="the-playable-build" class="anchor" href="#the-prototype-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----FAQs--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<h4>Can I tell everyone I know about this?</h1>
<p>Please don't. At least not yet. I take great pride in my work and the quality is definitely not yet high enough where I'd feel comfortable for the internet (or Capcom) to get their hands on it. It'd be torn to shreds in it's current state.</p>

<h4>Why are you making a fan game? Why not make something that you can sell?</h1>
<p>Great question. Unfortunately, game development is not very big in my part of the US and the past few times I've been a part of an indie team have not ended well. Having a demanding full time job and not being artistically talented doesn't help either. Becasue of all that I decided I'd use my fanboyish love for Capcom to develop a fan game when I wasn't working.</p>

<h4>Why are you using a 3D game engine to develop a 2D game?</h1>
<p>One day I plan to work on 3D games, so I figured I'd learn the ins and outs of 3D development by making a game in a 3D engine. It just happened to be a 2D game that I was making. Having worked with Unity before might have also had a factor in my decision.</p>

<h4>Ugh. Why are there so many conflicting artstyles with the sprites?</h1>
<p>It wouldn't have the Capcom feel if I didn't use an assortment of sprites from different games. But honestly, to realize the vision I had I needed to use sprites from different games.</p>

<h4>You do know that by using Capcom's materials you're stealing and they can sue you.</h1>
<p>Yeah I know. It's a fear I have that this project can have be end up in hot water. I'd stop and throw everything away at the dop of a hat if they asked me to. I'm a huge Capcom fan and I wouldn't want to upset a company whose developers I admire.</p>

<h4>Why are you working on this if you are afraid and are willing to drop it at a moments notice?</h1>
<p>For many reasons. One of which is experience, I'm a recent college grad who has very little experience in game devlopment due to my location, so any development work I do is a stepping stone.Even in these past two weeks, I've learned so much. Second, it's always been a dream of mine to work on and release a full game, and I decided that this is the project I would see through to the end, no matter how long or difficult the journay would be. Third, I love game development. I work 8/9 hour days and as soon as I get home I work another 5 or 6 hours on this. I find it fun and get such a rush when a new feature is implemented or a bug is fixed. I get the same feeling every time, "This is cool! I did this!". The fourth and final reason is that I want this to bring enjoyment to someone. If I can get at least one person to have fun with my game, then I have succeeded. As a game developer I want to give the same amount of joy to people as other developers have brought to me.  </p>
