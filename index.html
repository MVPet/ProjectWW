        <p>This is a project I have been working on for the past few weeks in my spare time. <br>I am developing it with Unity and C#.</p>

<h3>DISCLAIMER:<br>THIS IS A NONPROFIT FAN GAME.<br>IT IS IN NO WAY ENDORESED BY CAPCOM.<br>ALL CHARACTERS, GRAPHICS, AND MUSIC ARE OWNED BY CAPCOM.</h3>

<a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----What is This?----------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<p>This project originally began with me wanting to create a 2D version of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series. As I got around to planning it out, I discovered that a 2D Dynasty Warriors is very similar to a 2D Beat 'Em Up just with more enemies on screen.</p>

<p>From there I decided to make a game combing the two genres. Taking the mechanics of a Dynasty Warriors game, like the combat, bases, and objectives and adapting them into the style of some of my favorite Capcom Beat 'Em Ups. Since I love crossovers I decided that the cast and settings would all be focused around Capcom. A sort of Capcom All Star Beat 'Em Up.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-playable-build" class="anchor" href="#the-prototype-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----The Playable Build---------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<p>Thanks to Unity, the game is playable right in your browser (with the Unity Web Player installed)</p>

<p>There are two versions found below, a Stable Build and a Weekly Build. The Weekly Build is a newer build than the Stable Build and contains new features, but these features may be rough, unpolished, or slightly buggy. I guarantee that both builds can be played from start to finish.</p>

<p>The game can be played with both a keyboard and a controller (even in the browser version).<br>The controls are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movement is  'Arrow Keys' or 'WASD' on the keyboard. The left stick and D-Pad on a controller.</li>
<li>Light Attack is 'I' key on the keyboard or 'Button 0' on a controller.</li>
<li>Heavy Attack is 'O' key on the keyboard or 'Button 3' on the controller.</li>
<li>Dodge is 'P' key on the keyboard or 'Button 2' on the controller</li>
<li>Confirm/Start is 'Enter' key on the keyboard or 'Button 1' on the controller.</li>
<li>Pause is 'ESC' on the keyboard or 'Button 5' on the controller.</li>
</ul>

<p>The flow of combat is done by pressing Light Attack to start a low damaging combo then using Heavy Attack to perform a high damaging combo ender. Each ender is unique and depend on how many Light Attacks were used in the combo prior to the ender.</p>

<p>The combo list for the prototype is like so (H = Heavy Attack, L = Light Attack):</p>
<ul>
<li>H</li>
<li>LH</li>
<li>LLH</li>
<li>LLLH</li>
<li>LLLLH</li>
<li>LLLLL</li>
</ul>

<a id="the-future" class="anchor" href="#the-prototype-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----The Future--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<p>Assuming I am able to keep this project on the down low, I would like to release a demo build with 4 playable characters and a fully playable Free Play mode.</p>

<p>Assuming this is not shut down after the demo, I plan to release a fuller build that contains at least 8 playable characters and a variety of modes. As I am working on this in my free time by myself, this may not be for a while, but I plan on meeting this goal.</p>

<p>I have something planned for the classic Beat 'Em Up fans who may not like the radically different gameplay that this game has.</p>

<h3>
<a id="faqs" class="anchor" href="#the-prototype-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----FAQs-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<h4>Can I tell everyone I know about this?</h4>
<p>Please don't. At least not yet. I take great pride in my work and the quality is definitely not yet high enough where I'd feel comfortable for the internet (or Capcom) to get their hands on it. It'd be torn to shreds in it's current state.</p>

<h4>Why are you making a fan game? Why not make something that you can sell?</h4>
<p>Great question. Unfortunately, game development is not very big in my part of the US. Having a demanding full time job and not being artistically talented doesn't help either. Becasue of all that I decided I would use my fanboyish love for Capcom to develop a fan game.</p>

<h4>Why are you using a 3D game engine to develop a 2D game?</h4>
<p>One day I plan to work on 3D games, so I figured I'd learn the ins and outs of 3D development by making a game in a 3D engine. It just happened to be a 2D game that I am making. Devloping on a potato and having worked with Unity and C# before might have also had a factor in my decision.</p>

<h4>Ugh. Why are there so many conflicting artstyles with the sprites?</h4>
<p>It wouldn't have the Capcom feel if I didn't use an assortment of sprites from different games. But honestly, to realize the vision I have I needed to either make my own or use sprites from different games.</p>

<h4>Why are you making this?</h1>
<p>For a few reasons.</p? 
<p>One of which is experience, I'm a recent college grad, so any development work I do is a stepping stone for the future.</p> <p>Second, I love game development! I work a fairly demanding full time job and yet I'm always excited to get home and spend 3 or 4 hours implementing/tweaking features or fixing bugs. I get such a rush when I see my work start coming together. It's the same feeling everytime, "Look at it go! That's so cool!".</p> 
<p>Lastly, I want to make something that Capcom, Warriors, and Beat 'Em Up fans will enjoy. If at least one person has fun, then all this work will have been worth it. I want to bring the same amount of fun to people as other developers have brought to me.</p>
