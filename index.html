        <p>This is a project I have been working on for the past few weeks in my spare time.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----What is This?------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<p>This project originally began with me wanting to create a 2D version of TecmoKoei's Dynasty Warriors series. As I got around to planning it out, I discovered that a 2D Dynasty Warriors is very similar to a 2D Beat 'Em Up just with more enemies on screen.</p>

<p>From there I decided to make a game combing the two genres. Taking the mechanics of a Dynasty Warriors game, like the combat, bases, and objectives and adapting them into the style of some of my favorite Capcom Beat 'Em Ups.</p>

<p>The build that will be released will have 4 playable characters and a Free Play mode with randomly generated stages and objectives.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-playable-build" class="anchor" href="#the-prototype-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>-----The Playable Build------------------------------------------------------</h3>

<p>Below I've added a link that will allow you to play the prototype build in your web browser (thanks to Unity).</p>

<p>The contents of the prototype is a small three room stage. The stage has one of two randomly decided objectives. </p>

<p>These objectives are:</p>

<ul>
<li>KO a number of opponents, where to win you must defeat the specified number of enemies</li>
<li>Capture a number of bases, where you must capture the specified number of bases for yourself. Each base has a "health bar" and will spawn enemies once the player enters a base. All enemies defeated in the base will lower the base's health and once it hits 0 the base will be captured.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both keyboard and controllers can be used to play. The controls are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Movement is done by the 'Arrow Keys' and 'WASD' on the keyboard. The left stick and D-Pad on a controller.</li>
<li>Light Attack is the 'O' key on the keyboard or 'Button 0' on a controller.</li>
<li>Heavy Attack is the 'P' key on the keyboard or 'Button 3' on the controller.</li>
<li>Confirm/Start is the 'Enter' key on the keyboard or 'Button 1' on the controller.</li>
<li>Pause is 'ESC' on the keyboard or 'Button 5' on the controller.</li>
</ul>

<p>The flow of combat is done by pressing Light Attack to start a low damaging combo then using Heavy Attack to perform a high damaging combo ender. Each ender is unique and depend on how many Light Attacks were used in the combo prior to the ender.</p>

<p>The combo list for the prototype is like so (H = Heavy Attack, L = Light Attack):
H
LH
LLH
LLLH
LLLLH
LLLLL</p>

<p>Everything in the prototype is all placeholder and I own none of the placeholders used (Music, Graphics, Fonts). </p>
<p>They are all owned by Capcom.</p>
