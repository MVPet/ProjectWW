        <p>This is a personal project I have been working on for the past week in my spare time.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-game" class="anchor" href="#the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Game:</h3>

<p>I am working on creating an old-school 2D style beat-em up similar to the Streets of Rage series or Capcom's many arcade offerings.</p>

<p>I wanted to mix things up, by implementing some systems from TecmoKoei's Dynasty Warriors series. From Dynasty Warriors I've included the combat mechanics and the objective-based stage system.</p>

<p>I will avoid going too much into detail as things might change as I develop this (and I need to have a few secrets to eventually show off).</p>

<p>As for why I am using Unity, I have spent many hours creating an "engine" and the required toolsets that I never get to truly make the game I wanted to. Using Unity I can get right to developing the game and using C# allows me to use a language I'm familiar with.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-prototype-game" class="anchor" href="#the-prototype-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Prototype Game:</h3>

<p>Below I've added a link that will allow you to play the prototype build in your web browser (thanks to Unity).</p>

<p>The contents of the prototype is a small three room stage. The stage has one of two randomly decided objectives. </p>

<p>These objectives are:</p>

<ul>
<li>KO a number of opponents, where to win you must defeat the specified number of enemies</li>
<li>Capture a number of bases, where you must capture the specified number of bases for yourself. Each base has a "health bar" and will spawn enemies once the player enters a base. All enemies defeated in the base will lower the base's health and once it hits 0 the base will be captured.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both keyboard and controllers can be used to play. The controls are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Movement is done by the 'Arrow Keys' and 'WASD' on the keyboard. The left stick and D-Pad on a controller.</li>
<li>Light Attack is the 'O' key on the keyboard or 'Button 0' on a controller.</li>
<li>Heavy Attack is the 'P' key on the keyboard or 'Button 3' on the controller.</li>
<li>Confirm/Start is the 'Enter' key on the keyboard or 'Button 1' on the controller.</li>
<li>Pause is 'ESC' on the keyboard or 'Button 5' on the controller.</li>
</ul>

<p>The flow of combat is done by pressing Light Attack to start a low damaging combo then using Heavy Attack to perform a high damaging combo ender. Each ender is unique and depend on how many Light Attacks were used in the combo prior to the ender.</p>

<p>The combo list for the prototype is like so (H = Heavy Attack, L = Light Attack):
H
LH
LLH
LLLH
LLLLH
LLLLL</p>

<p>Everything in the prototype is all placeholder and I own none of the placeholders used (Music, Graphics, Fonts). 
They are all owned by Capcom.
