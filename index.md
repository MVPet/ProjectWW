<h3><p align = "center">What Is This?</p></h3>

<p>This project originally began with me wanting to create a 2D version of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series. As I got around to planning it out, I discovered that a 2D Dynasty Warriors is very similar to a 2D Beat 'Em Up just with more enemies on screen.</p>

<p>From there I decided to make a game combing the two genres. Taking the mechanics of a Dynasty Warriors game, like the combat, bases, and objectives and adapting them into the style of some of my favorite Capcom Beat 'Em Ups. Since I love crossovers I decided that the cast and settings would all be focused around Capcom. A sort of Capcom All Star Beat 'Em Up.</p>

<h3><p align = "center">The Playable Build</p></h3>

<p>Thanks to Unity, the game is playable right in your browser (with the Unity Web Player installed)</p>

<p>The flow of combat is done by pressing Light Attack to start a low damaging combo then using Heavy Attack to perform a high damaging combo ender. Each ender is unique and depend on how many Light Attacks were used in the combo prior to the ender.</p>

<p>The combo list for the prototype is like so (H = Heavy Attack, L = Light Attack):</p>
<ul>
<li>H</li>
<li>LH</li>
<li>LLH</li>
<li>LLLH</li>
<li>LLLLH</li>
<li>LLLLL</li>
</ul>

<p>Stable Build Notes:
- June 27, 2016
  - Sorry for the late update, but things ahve been busy lately and I did not have much time to work on this.
  - In addition, this is the last update. I will not be working on this project anymore. The fire is no longer there and I have learned what I wanted to learn from Unity.
  - Maybe one day I'll go back to this idea, but as of now I'm going off to work on a new project in a custom made Engine.
  - Come back in a month or so and I might have something to show off.
