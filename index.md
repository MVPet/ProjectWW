<p>This project originally began with me wanting to create a 2D version of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series. As I got around to planning it out, I discovered that a 2D Dynasty Warriors is very similar to a 2D Beat 'Em Up so I decided to make a game combining the two concepts, a 2D Beat Em Up with Dynasty Warriors gameplay. I decided to use Street Fighter as the theme since my favorite Beat Em Ups were made by Capcom and a Street Fighter Warriors sounded like a cool idea.</p>

<h3><p align = "center">The Demo</p></h3>

<p>The demo consists of 1 stage and 2 playable characters, Ryu and Chun-Li (who needs to be unlocked). In Dynasty Warriors fasion there are missions to complete in the stage culminating in a boss fight at the endm which, in the demo, are to Defeat 15 Enemies, Capture 1 Case, and to Defeat Ryu. Unlike most 2D Beat Em Us, the stage is one map that can be traversed, complete with a branching path and a hidden area to find.</p>

<p>Combat is done by pressing Light Attack to start a low damaging combo then using Heavy Attack to perform a high damaging combo ender. Each ender is unique and depend on how many Light Attacks were used in the combo prior to the ender.</p>

<p>The combo list for the prototype is like so (H = Heavy Attack, L = Light Attack):</p>
<ul>
<li>H</li>
<li>LH</li>
<li>LLH</li>
<li>LLLH</li>
<li>LLLLH</li>
<li>LLLLL</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Unity, the game is playable right in your browser <a href="http://mvpet.github.io/ProjectWW/WeeklyBuild.html">HERE</a> (Unity Web Player required).</p>
